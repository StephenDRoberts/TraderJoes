Trader Joe's is a simple text based game based off Drug Wars. This was my first game made in Ruby during my graduate training.

The aim is to buy/sell goods to make a profit by the end of the period (initially set to 10 days). After the 10th day your total balance is returned which indicates your score.

There is a limit to the amount of goods you can hold, currently set to 50 items.

v1 of the game is functional, however there are many updates required to make it a complete version (see features.txt to see a list of features I'd like to incorporate into the game).

This game was made in Ruby and can be started by inputting ruby TraderHoes.rb in the terminal.
